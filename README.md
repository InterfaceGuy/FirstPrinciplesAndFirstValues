# FirstPrinciplesAndFirstValues

First Principles refer to the ability to break down complexity into self-evident, irreducibly fundamental principles that serve as an axiomatic basis for understanding observed phenomena. These principles are known through thought and correspond to truth. In contrast, First Values are known through feeling and correspond to goodness. They represent fundamental, self-evident values from which complex situations can be understood.

  

First Principles alone are insufficient for a thriving culture or living system, as they represent only the rational side of a larger coin. First Values, the trans-rational counterpart, exceed the limitations of the rational mind and can be known through feeling. A healthy culture requires an understanding that First Principles must serve First Values for the entire system to thrive, balancing rational and trans-rational approaches like yin and yang.
